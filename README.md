# Bushfire-Simulation-COMP10001
Model of a bushfire spreading across a landscape represented as a two-dimensional grid. The speed and direction that a bushfire will spread in is affected by many factors, 
including the amount and type of fuel (trees) available, the slope of the land, and the direction of the wind. This model will help forecast how much damage (number of grid squares burnt) 
a fire will do before it burns out.
